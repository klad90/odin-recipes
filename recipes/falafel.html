    <h2>Easiest Falafel</h2>
    <p>Super quick and easy - you will probably have all the ingredients in your pantry already!
         Serve with your favorite sauce! I served mine with spicy mayo,
          made by mixing 3 tablespoons mayo with 1/2 tablespoon sriracha.
           It would also be great with tzatziki or spicy mustard.    </p>
    <h3>Ingridents</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) can garbanzo beans, drained</li>
